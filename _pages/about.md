Hello! My name is Jilong Li (李觊龙). I am a student at School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen and will be studying for my master's degree. My research interest includes Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), deep learning and neural models. Colleagues engaged in BCI research are very welcome to exchange experiences together.
